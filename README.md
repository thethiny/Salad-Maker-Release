## How to Use
This app is a python webapp that runs in your browser. It uses the Steam App to connect to the game servers on your behalf. You are able to connect in 3 ways:

- Using Steam (recommended): It will use the Steam Client to create a new token.
- Using a token: Xbox Token starts with `XBL3.0`, Steam starts with `080`, Epic Games starts with `ey`.
- Using the game: If you're using ASIMK11 / MK12TTH then you can get your token from the game directly.
- Using the history feature: If you have logged in before then you can re-use the token. Note that you can "copy" the token from the history in case you wanna use it elsewhere or in the previous version.

Once you login to the game, you will need to have the game data zip file. The game data zip will be called gamename`_data.zip` (will be changed in the future to game`.data`) and you should NOT extract it. The app will extract the files for you and place them inside dumps. 

Using the tool is simple, find the items you want and add them to cart then unlock them. For currency and experience and floyd they're in the profile icon on the top of the screen. There are also refresh buttons in case something gets stuck. You can also copy the session token from the profile section, which is useless unless you're an app developer.


If you face any issues contact me on twitter or discord. I do not always respond on nexus.

## [Privacy Notice]
Your token never leaves the browser, it is not sent to my server, and it is only used to send it to the python code that is running on your computer. You will notice it say proxy but that is simply the python app running which is called proxy.

You might get a Windows Smart Screen notice or Chrome Virus Blocked, this is because the Steam DLL that is required is inside the exe, and Antivirus software hates that. 

This tool requires an active internet connection because it connects to the Steam and WB servers. The code is available [here](https://github.com/thethiny/NRS-Boiler-Room) ï»¿and will be made public after the tool is final and builds up enough reputation.
If you really really really need the code, then once you open the exe the first line will say "App running in ...", this is the folder where the python + webapp code are, and you can copy it wherever you want and run it using python. The requirements are easy to pick up cuz the errors say what's missing.
